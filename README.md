It is possible to learn the basics of probability and statistics for Python finance within 2-3 weeks if you focus on the core concepts and apply them directly to financial problems. The key is to prioritize learning the most relevant topics and practice coding in Python using libraries that are frequently used in finance, such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**.

Here’s a focused plan for 2-3 weeks to help you achieve this goal:

#### **Day 5-6: Descriptive Statistics in Python**
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
     - Skewness and kurtosis (for understanding return distributions in finance)
     - Covariance and correlation (important for portfolio analysis)
   
   **Python Practice**:
   - Use **pandas** to compute summary statistics for financial data.
   - Work with historical stock data (download via `yfinance` library) to calculate daily returns, mean, variance, and covariance.

   **Resources**:
   - Python libraries: `pandas`, `yfinance`, `numpy`
   - Financial data sources: Yahoo Finance API, `yfinance` library

### **Week 2: Inferential Statistics and Financial Applications**

#### **Day 7-8: Hypothesis Testing**
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Null and alternative hypotheses
     - Z-tests, T-tests (for testing means and comparing returns)
     - P-values and confidence intervals

   **Python Practice**:
   - Use `scipy.stats` to perform hypothesis tests on financial data.
   - Example: Test whether the average return of two stocks is significantly different.

   **Resources**:
   - Python library: `scipy.stats`
   - Example use case: Comparing stock performance using t-tests

#### **Day 9-10: Regression Analysis**
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Linear regression (important for predicting stock prices, returns)
     - Multiple regression (used for more complex models like factor models)
     - R-squared, adjusted R-squared (measure of model fit)

   **Python Practice**:
   - Use `statsmodels` or `scikit-learn` for regression analysis on financial datasets.
   - Predict stock returns using independent variables like market return (CAPM model).

   **Resources**:
   - Python libraries: `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`
   - Example project: Implement CAPM model or perform linear regression on stock returns
   
#### **Day 11-12: Time Series Analysis**
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Autocorrelation and stationarity (important for analyzing financial time series data)
     - Moving averages, ARIMA models (forecasting stock prices or returns)
     - Volatility modeling (GARCH models)

   **Python Practice**:
   - Analyze stock price trends and volatility using time series methods.
   - Apply ARIMA models to forecast future prices or returns.

   **Resources**:
   - Python libraries: `statsmodels`, `pandas`
   - Use `arch` library for GARCH models

### **Week 3: Applications in Python Finance**

#### **Day 13-14: Portfolio Analysis and Risk Metrics**
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Portfolio returns and risk (mean-variance optimization)
     - Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Value-at-Risk (VaR)
     - Diversification, efficient frontier

   **Python Practice**:
   - Use historical stock data to create and analyze portfolios.
   - Compute the Sharpe ratio, VaR, and optimize the portfolio using Python.

   **Resources**:
   - Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.optimize` (for portfolio optimization)
   - Example project: Build an efficient frontier for a set of stocks
   
#### **Day 15-16: Monte Carlo Simulations**
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Simulate price movements (using random walks, Geometric Brownian Motion)
     - Risk analysis and option pricing using Monte Carlo simulations
     - Model stock prices or project future portfolio values

   **Python Practice**:
   - Simulate stock prices over time using Monte Carlo methods.
   - Apply the simulations for risk analysis or to calculate option prices (Black-Scholes model).

   **Resources**:
   - Python libraries: `numpy`, `scipy.stats`
   - Example project: Monte Carlo simulation of stock price movements

#### **Day 17-18: Data Visualization and Presentation**
